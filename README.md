# Click Search

## Description

Click Search is the Google Chrome extension that me and my team developed for our senior capstone project
at Oakland University. It makes use of the YouTube Data api to retrieve data from the youtube video that
the user is currently watching and the OpenAI api to make quick, on-the-fly queries to ChatGPT about the
topic of said video.

I am currently in the process of refactoring the project so that it no longer requires depreciated dependencies
and utilizes the current standard practices for React projects. For example, while the previous version was
created using the create-react-app build tool, my version will be a React Vite project.

This is a work in progress currently. The project can be built and uploaded as a Chrome Extension, but it
will not function as intended.
